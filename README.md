# Codebase, Analysis and Datasets (Project: Belief Persistence, at EuroVis 2023)

_**paper:** "Belief Decay or Persistence? A Mixed-method Study on Belief Movement Over Time"_


## Folders Description:
1. **3-trial-quant-qual:** Contains datasets (especially slicing performed) used in the exploratory analysis.
      --> quant-for-qual: quantitative analysis for qualitative trends
      --> qual-for-quant: qualitative analysis for quantitative trends

2. **data:** Contains datasets used for: 
      --> quantitative analysis
      --> qualitative analysis and prototypical coding performed (as well as grouping/slicing for decay, maintenance, and strengthen)
      --> pilot data collected (version 1 to version 3)
      --> exploratory analysis (consistency analysis)

3. **plots:** Contains plots produced for the paper. The remaining plots (if not present) can be found in scripts: belief persistence.Rproj, paper_plots,ipynb
